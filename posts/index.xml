      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s well known that closed-source operating systems (like Windows and macOS) aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly good for privacy &amp;amp; security. There&amp;rsquo;s essentially no way for a closed-source system&amp;rsquo;s code to be verified.
Which is why people concerned about their privacy &amp;amp; security should use Libre operating systems, such as Linux. But that&amp;rsquo;s not where it ends.
The Intel Management Engine Intel&amp;rsquo;s Management Engine (ME for short, which is what I&amp;rsquo;ll be calling it) is a seperate computing enviornment present on every Intel chip since mid 2006.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that everyone should have a website.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a big, gigantic project, it could even just be a page that says hello.
Our identities on the internet often only exist on others&#39; websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Having your own website puts you in control, and that&amp;rsquo;s important for an open web.
Not to say social media is necessarily bad - we&amp;rsquo;ve just put too much control in big, for-profit companies.</description>
