      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that everyone should have a website.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a big, gigantic project, it could even just be a page that says hello.
Our identities on the internet often only exist on others&#39; websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Having your own website puts you in control, and that&amp;rsquo;s important for an open web.
Not to say social media is necessarily bad - we&amp;rsquo;ve just put too much control in big, for-profit companies.</description>
