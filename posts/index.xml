      <description>Privacy is one of the most important things we have. But, in the “digital age”, it seems to be slipping further and further away.
Most people have taken convenience over the basic right of privacy. For instance, Google is (arguably) the best search engine out there – it can fetch millions of results in a fraction of a second, usually has exactly what you’re looking for, and has a fairly modern design.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s well known that closed-source operating systems (like Windows and macOS) aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly good for privacy &amp;amp; security. There&amp;rsquo;s essentially no way for a closed-source system&amp;rsquo;s code to be verified.
Which is why people concerned about their privacy &amp;amp; security should use Libre operating systems, such as Linux. But that&amp;rsquo;s not where it ends.
The Intel Management Engine Intel&amp;rsquo;s Management Engine (ME for short, which is what I&amp;rsquo;ll be calling it) is a seperate computing enviornment present on every Intel chip since mid 2006.</description>

      <title>The &#34;Open&#34; Web</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that everyone should have a website.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a big, gigantic project, it could even just be a page that says hello.
Our identities on the internet often only exist on others&#39; websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Having your own website puts you in control, and that&amp;rsquo;s important for an open web.
Not to say social media is necessarily bad - we&amp;rsquo;ve just put too much control in big, for-profit companies.</description>
