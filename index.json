[{"content":"Privacy is one of the most important things we have. But, in the “digital age”, it seems to be slipping further and further away.\nMost people have taken convenience over the basic right of privacy. For instance, Google is (arguably) the best search engine out there – it can fetch millions of results in a fraction of a second, usually has exactly what you’re looking for, and has a fairly modern design. But, on the other hand, they\u0026rsquo;re also storing every search query you make, where you made that search from, and using it to serve you personalized ads.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not just search - you likely use Google products in multiple aspects of your daily life. They control your phone\u0026rsquo;s operating system, your photo storage, navigation, and much more.\nAnd you begin to think: should we trust them with all this sensitive data? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s quite simple: no.\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s only priority is increasing their stock, making more money for their shareholders. Everything they do is strategically designed to make you feel like you can trust them, when, in reality, they\u0026rsquo;re just trying to make as much money as possible of of you.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t exclusive to Google, either - this applies to pretty much every big tech company - Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Verizon, Yahoo, etc..\nIt\u0026rsquo;s especially concerning when you also realize that they\u0026rsquo;re sharing this information with each other \u0026amp; the government.\nThis is why I try to use \u0026amp; promote open-source tech - there\u0026rsquo;s no trust involved with it if you can read the code yourself. Personally, I use services like ProtonMail, Tutanota, and Signal - they\u0026rsquo;re all open-source, private and secure, but still have great features. PrivacyTools.io is a great place to find alternatives to more products \u0026amp; services.\n","permalink":"https://nchristopher.me/posts/why-privacy-matters/","summary":"Privacy is one of the most important things we have.

There\u0026rsquo;s essentially no way for a closed-source system\u0026rsquo;s code to be verified.\nWhich is why people concerned about their privacy \u0026amp; security should use Libre operating systems, such as Linux. But that\u0026rsquo;s not where it ends.\nThe Intel Management Engine Intel\u0026rsquo;s Management Engine (ME for short, which is what I\u0026rsquo;ll be calling it) is a seperate computing enviornment present on every Intel chip since mid 2006. The ME has it\u0026rsquo;s own storage, memory, cache, along with direct access to the computer\u0026rsquo;s RAM and network access. The ME is signed by Intel, and the computer wont boot unless the signature is valid.\nThe ME contains a web server allowing remote users to manage the computer - even while the PC is turned off (as long as the motherboard has power). While traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS, pretty much every version of SSL/TLS has had major vulnerabilities.\nAnd this issue isn\u0026rsquo;t even intel-specific - AMD has a similar product called \u0026ldquo;Platform Security Processor\u0026rdquo;, though it\u0026rsquo;s implementation is quite different.\nTLDR The Intel Management Engine can be (and likely is) used as a backdoor, with complete access to the system over the internet. And it cannot be disabled on modern Intel chips.\nReferences For further reading, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend checking out my sources:\n Libreboot\u0026rsquo;s FAQ on the Intel Management Engine Libreboot\u0026rsquo;s FAQ on AMD Intel Management Engine on Wikipedia Attacks against TLS/SSL on Wikipedia  I thought this was a pretty important issue that a lot of people didn\u0026rsquo;t know about, which is why I wrote a post on it. Just goes to show that you can\u0026rsquo;t trust hardware either.\n","permalink":"https://nchristopher.me/posts/cpu-backdoor/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s well known that closed-source operating systems (like Windows and macOS) aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly good for privacy \u0026amp; security.

Having your own website puts you in control, and that\u0026rsquo;s important for an open web.\nNot to say social media is necessarily bad - we\u0026rsquo;ve just put too much control in big, for-profit companies. If all the big platforms decided to ban your accounts, you\u0026rsquo;d likely be wiped off from the internet. Unless you had a substantial following, you would probably be forgotten, with little evidence you ever existed on those sites. Having your own website circumvents this.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the problem: despite the internet being an open standard, the web is quite centralized (which is a bad thing). While I\u0026rsquo;m sure companies like ICANN have great intentions, it\u0026rsquo;s still not great.\nTake Bitcoin for example, while there\u0026rsquo;s still a central entity publishing it\u0026rsquo;s protocol, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to follow that to use Bitcoin (though most people do, as it is quite good). The control still resides with the end user. The web should be more like this.\n","permalink":"https://nchristopher.me/posts/the-open-web/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought that everyone should have a website.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a big, gigantic project, it could even just be a page that says hello.\nOur identities on the internet often only exist on others' websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
