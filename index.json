[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought that everyone should have a website.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a big, gigantic project, it could even just be a page that says hello.\nOur identities on the internet often only exist on others' websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Having your own website puts you in control, and that\u0026rsquo;s important for an open web.\nNot to say social media is necessarily bad - we\u0026rsquo;ve just put too much control in big, for-profit companies. If all the big platforms decided to ban your accounts, you\u0026rsquo;d likely be wiped off from the internet. Unless you had a substantial following, you would probably be forgotten, with little evidence you ever existed on those sites. Having your own website circumvents this.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the problem: despite the internet being an open standard, the web is quite centralized (which is a bad thing). While I\u0026rsquo;m sure companies like ICANN have great intentions, it\u0026rsquo;s still not great.\nTake Bitcoin for example, while there\u0026rsquo;s still a central entity publishing it\u0026rsquo;s protocol, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to follow that to use Bitcoin (though most people do, as it is quite good). The control still resides with the end user. The web should be more like this.\n","permalink":"https://nchristopher.me/posts/the-open-web/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought that everyone should have a website.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a big, gigantic project, it could even just be a page that says hello.\nOur identities on the internet often only exist on others' websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
