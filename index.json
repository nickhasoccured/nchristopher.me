[{"content":"Signal was a refreshing take on privacy. It employed strong end-to-end encryption, was open-source, and was something I could genuinely put my trust in.\nHowever, that has changed recently. Signal introduced crypto payments in the latest preview of their app - and it\u0026rsquo;s more or less just a scam. For starters, they\u0026rsquo;re using \u0026ldquo;MobileCoin\u0026rdquo;, which nobody has ever heard of. But the real issue is that the coin is pre-mined, in other words, every coin has already been created.\nThey sold around 25% of it to investors, and kept the remainder. Which means that if people begin to use the currency \u0026amp; give it value, they can sell their coins and create money out of thin air. And that\u0026rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t the first time Signal has disappointed me, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never actually felt betrayed by them.\n You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them. bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness.\n For the past year or so, Signal (for whatever reason) neglected to release their server\u0026rsquo;s source code. While it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to verify they\u0026rsquo;re actually running this (it means nothing privacy-wise), it still lets the code be audited, and free software is usually just better. They did (finally) update the repository a few days ago, but only after hundreds of requests to do so.\nUnless Signal drastically changes \u0026amp; fixes this issue, I\u0026rsquo;ll likely no longer be using the platform. Maybe someone will fork it for the better, who knows. For now, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try to switch to Matrix, which seems to be doing well.\n","permalink":"https://nchristopher.me/posts/goodbye-signal/","summary":"Signal was a refreshing take on privacy.

It was relatively easy for me, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have many files to transfer (most of my disk space was used by programs), and the Ubuntu installation process is much more user-friendly.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been gradually switching to FOSS services, so using Ubuntu (or pretty much any Linux distro, for that matter) was a no-brainer. I kept using Windows for so long because, for the most part, it worked well. It\u0026rsquo;s still a great operating system, but I was fed up with some things (eg. Windows search breaking, lackluster performance), and the privacy-invasive model of Windows 10.\nImpressions The first thing I noticed was how consistent the user-interface was. When Microsoft does their interface right, it looks good - but that\u0026rsquo;s far from often, Windows has gone through many different versions, and old(er) interfaces aren\u0026rsquo;t kept up-to-date. With Ubuntu, the user interface looks great, while still being much more customizable than Windows'. In fact, I failed to find a singular application that didn\u0026rsquo;t match my theme.\nI installed the Yaru Blue theme (a tweaked version of the default one) in my home directory, which is the central place for everything user-related. While Windows does have user directories, files are usually still spread throughout many other folders, and the dreaded Registry.\nAnother nice feature is the package manager. With a single command, it\u0026rsquo;ll fetch \u0026amp; install the latest version of whatever package you want. This is better than having to search the internet for an installer. And it keeps track of dependencies, so when something is no longer in use, it can be automatically removed.\nNew Stuff It did take some re-learning, but I expected that. Most of the general shortcuts you\u0026rsquo;d expect are the same (eg. clipboard functions, opening the Applications Menu, and quickly opening programs), but I\u0026rsquo;m used to lesser-known shortcuts, like opening the Task Manager with CTRL + SHIFT + ESC. Thankfully, Ubuntu provides a simple shortcut manager - you can even create new ones!\nBy default, clicking your middle-mouse button will paste - however, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t paste your clipboard. Instead, it pastes whatever you last selected. Unfortunately, I haven\u0026rsquo;t found a way to disable it (apart from in GNOME applications). This feature is quite strange, and should probably be removed.\nKDE Connect is another thing I now have access to. While it\u0026rsquo;s also available for Windows, it was originally made for Linux, and works better here. I use a reimplimentation of KDE Connect for GNOME called GSConnect. It integrates really well with Ubuntu, and I like it a lot!\nAt first glance, Linux\u0026rsquo;s file structure can look complicated. However, the more I used it, the more it made a lot more sense. Entering file paths is a breeze, thanks to the ~ shortcut for your home folder (I\u0026rsquo;d have to enter C:\\Users\\curio\\ to get the same thing before!).\nWhile Windows has a terminal, it\u0026rsquo;s not nearly as powerful as Linux\u0026rsquo;s. When Microsoft adds something, they usually don\u0026rsquo;t add an equivalent way to do it with CMD. On Linux, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anything that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t also do with the Terminal.\nOverall, I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with my decision to switch, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see what else I can do with Ubuntu!\n","permalink":"https://nchristopher.me/posts/ubuntu-review/","summary":"Around a week ago, I decided to finally bite the bullet \u0026amp; switch to Ubuntu.

But, in the “digital age”, it seems to be slipping further and further away.\nMost people have taken convenience over the basic right of privacy. For instance, Google is (arguably) the best search engine out there – it can fetch millions of results in a fraction of a second, usually has exactly what you’re looking for, and has a fairly modern design. But, on the other hand, they\u0026rsquo;re also storing every search query you make, where you made that search from, and using it to serve you personalized ads.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not just search - you likely use Google products in multiple aspects of your daily life. They control your phone\u0026rsquo;s operating system, your photo storage, navigation, and much more.\nAnd you begin to think: should we trust them with all this sensitive data? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s quite simple: no.\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s only priority is increasing their stock, making more money for their shareholders. Everything they do is strategically designed to make you feel like you can trust them, when, in reality, they\u0026rsquo;re just trying to make as much money as possible out of you.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t exclusive to Google, either - this applies to pretty much every big tech company - Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Verizon, Yahoo, etc..\nIt\u0026rsquo;s especially concerning when you also realize that they\u0026rsquo;re sharing this information with each other \u0026amp; the government.\nThis is why I try to use \u0026amp; promote open-source tech - there\u0026rsquo;s no trust involved with it if you can read the code yourself. Personally, I use services like ProtonMail, Bitwarden, and Signal - they\u0026rsquo;re all open-source, private and secure, but still have great features. PrivacyTools.io is a great place to find alternatives to more products \u0026amp; services.\n","permalink":"https://nchristopher.me/posts/why-privacy-matters/","summary":"Privacy is one of the most important things we have.

The ME is signed by Intel, and the computer wont boot unless the signature is valid.\nThe ME contains a web server allowing remote users to manage the computer - even while the PC is turned off (as long as the motherboard has power). While traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS, pretty much every version of SSL/TLS has had major vulnerabilities.\nAnd this issue isn\u0026rsquo;t even intel-specific - AMD has a similar product called \u0026ldquo;Platform Security Processor\u0026rdquo;, though it\u0026rsquo;s implementation is quite different.\nTLDR The Intel Management Engine can be (and likely is) used as a backdoor, with complete access to the system over the internet.
