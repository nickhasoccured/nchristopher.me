[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought that everyone should have a website.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a big, gigantic thing, it could even just be a page that says hi.\nOur online identities often only exist on others' websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Having your own website puts you in control, and that\u0026rsquo;s extremely important for an open web.\nNot to say social media is some horrible thing, but it\u0026rsquo;s quite scary to think just how much control big tech companies have over the internet.\nFor example, think about much you might depend on Facebook (it\u0026rsquo;s probably quite a bit). Now imagine if they just decided to ban your account because you didn\u0026rsquo;t make them enough money. That would affect you tremendously - having your own website means you\u0026rsquo;re the one in control, not some gigantic corporation.\n","permalink":"https://nchristopher.me/posts/the-open-web/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought that everyone should have a website.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a big, gigantic thing, it could even just be a page that says hi.\nOur online identities often only exist on others' websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

There\u0026rsquo;s essentially no way for a closed-source system\u0026rsquo;s code to be verified.\nWhich is why people concerned about their privacy \u0026amp; security should use Libre operating systems, such as Linux. But that\u0026rsquo;s not where it ends.\nThe Intel Management Engine Intel\u0026rsquo;s Management Engine (ME for short, which is what I\u0026rsquo;ll be calling it) is a seperate computing enviornment present on every Intel chip since mid 2006. The ME has it\u0026rsquo;s own storage, memory, cache, along with direct access to the computer\u0026rsquo;s RAM and network access. The ME is signed by Intel, and the computer wont boot unless the signature is valid.\nThe ME contains a web server allowing remote users to manage the computer - even while the PC is turned off (as long as the motherboard has power). While traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS, pretty much every version of SSL/TLS has had major vulnerabilities.\nAnd this issue isn\u0026rsquo;t even intel-specific - AMD has a similar product called \u0026ldquo;Platform Security Processor\u0026rdquo;, though it\u0026rsquo;s implementation is quite different.\nTLDR The Intel Management Engine can be (and likely is) used as a backdoor, with complete access to the system over the internet. And it cannot be disabled on modern Intel chips.\nReferences For further reading, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend checking out my sources:\n Libreboot\u0026rsquo;s FAQ on the Intel Management Engine Libreboot\u0026rsquo;s FAQ on AMD Intel Management Engine on Wikipedia Attacks against TLS/SSL on Wikipedia  I thought this was a pretty important issue that a lot of people didn\u0026rsquo;t know about, which is why I wrote a post on it. Just goes to show that you can\u0026rsquo;t trust hardware either.\n","permalink":"https://nchristopher.me/posts/cpu-backdoor/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s well known that closed-source operating systems (like Windows and macOS) aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly good for privacy \u0026amp; security.
