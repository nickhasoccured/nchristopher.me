### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Nick!

I write code, sometimes it works. I'm currently using a (mostly) web-based tech stack, but I'm looking to branch out in the future! I'm a big fan of privacy & open-source software, so most of my projects reflect that:

-   [**Quoter**](https://github.com/nchristopher/quoter) - a Discord bot which stores quotes for servers & retrieves them on demand. It supports listing, (randomly) displaying, deleting, and editing quotes!
-   [**PPS Credentials**](https://github.com/nchristopher/pps-credentials) - a tool for PPS students to generate default credentials for their account.
-   [**AutoPublisher**](https://github.com/nchristopher/autopublisher) - a simple Discord bot that automatically publishes messages in announcement channels.

Thanks for stopping by my website! This website was generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) along with the awesome [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme. Go check them out!
