Hello, I'm Nick! I make open-source software for the internet. My projects aim to be useful to me or (_hopefully_) useful to others. I’m currently using web-based languages, but I’m looking to branch out in the future!

**Here's what I'm working on:**

-   [**Quoter**](https://github.com/nickhasoccured/quoter) - a Discord bot which stores quotes for servers & retrieves them on demand. It supports listing, (randomly) displaying, deleting, and editing quotes!
-   [**PPS Credentials**](https://github.com/nickhasoccured/pps-credentials) - a tool for PPS students to generate default credentials for their account.
-   [**AutoPublisher**](https://github.com/nickhasoccured/autopublisher) - a simple Discord bot that automatically publishes messages in announcement channels.

Thanks for stopping by my website! I try to post here at least once a week. This website was generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) along with the awesome [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme. Go check them out!
