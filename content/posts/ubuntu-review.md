Around a week ago, I decided to finally bite the bullet & switch to Ubuntu. It was relatively easy for me, I didn't have many files to transfer (most of my disk space was used by programs), and the Ubuntu installation process is much more user-friendly.

I've been gradually switching to FOSS services, so using Ubuntu (or pretty much any Linux distro, for that matter) was a no-brainer. I kept using Windows for so long because, for the most part, it worked well. It's still a great operating system, but I was fed up with some things (eg. Windows search breaking, lackluster performance), and the privacy-invasive model of Windows 10.

## Impressions

The first thing I noticed was how _consistent_ the user-interface was. When Microsoft does their interface right, it looks good - but that's far from often, Windows has gone through many different versions, and old(er) interfaces aren't kept up-to-date. With Ubuntu, the user interface looks great, while still being much more customizable than Windows'. In fact, I failed to find a singular application that _didn't_ match my theme.

I installed the [Yaru Blue](https://github.com/Jannomag/Yaru-Colors) theme (a tweaked version of the default one) in my home directory, which is the central place for _everything_ user-related. While Windows _does_ have user directories, files are usually still spread throughout many other folders, and the dreaded [Registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry).

Another nice feature is the **package manager**. With a single command, it'll fetch & install the latest version of whatever package you want. This is better than having to search the internet for an installer. And it keeps track of dependencies, so when something is no longer in use, it can be automatically removed.

## New Stuff

It did take some re-learning, but I expected that. Most of the general shortcuts you'd expect are the same (eg. clipboard functions, opening the Applications Menu, and quickly opening programs), but I'm used to lesser-known shortcuts, like opening the Task Manager with `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `ESC`. Thankfully, Ubuntu provides a simple shortcut manager - you can even create new ones!

By default, clicking your middle-mouse button will paste - _however_, it doesn't paste your clipboard. Instead, it pastes whatever you last selected. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to disable it (apart from in [GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME) applications). This feature is quite strange, and should probably be removed.

[KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) is another thing I now have access to. While it's also available for Windows, it was originally made for Linux, and works better here. I use a reimplimentation of KDE Connect for GNOME called [GSConnect](https://github.com/GSConnect/gnome-shell-extension-gsconnect). It integrates really well with Ubuntu, and I like it a lot!

At first glance, Linux's file structure can look complicated. However, the more I used it, the more it made a lot more sense. Entering file paths is a breeze, thanks to the `~` shortcut for your home folder (I'd have to enter `C:\Users\curio\` to get the same thing before!).

While Windows has a terminal, it's not nearly as powerful as Linux's. When Microsoft adds something, they usually don't add an equivalent way to do it with CMD. On Linux, I couldn't find anything that I couldn't _also_ do with the Terminal.

Overall, I'm quite happy with my decision to switch, and I'm excited to see what else I can do with Ubuntu!
