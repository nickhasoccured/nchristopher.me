Privacy is one of the most important things we have. But, in the “digital age”, it seems to be slipping further and further away.

Most people have taken convenience _over_ the basic right of privacy. For instance, **Google** is (arguably) the best search engine out there – it can fetch millions of results in a fraction of a second, usually has exactly what you’re looking for, and has a fairly modern design. But, on the _other_ hand, they're also storing _every_ search query you make, _where_ you made that search from, and using it to serve you personalized ads.

And it's not just search - you likely use Google products in multiple aspects of your daily life. They control your phone's [operating system](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)>), your [photo storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos), [navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps), and [much more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products).

And you begin to think: should we trust them with all this _sensitive_ data? Well, that's quite simple: **no**.

Google's _only_ priority is increasing their stock, making more money for their shareholders. Everything they do is strategically designed to make you _feel_ like you can trust them, when, in reality, they're just trying to make as much money as possible of of you.

This isn't exclusive to Google, either - this applies to pretty much _every_ big tech company - Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Verizon, Yahoo, etc..

It's especially concerning when you _also_ realize that they're [sharing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)>) this information with each other & the government.

This is why I try to use & promote open-source tech - there's no trust involved with it _if_ you can read the code yourself. Personally, I use services like [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com), [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com), and [Signal](https://signal.org) - they're all open-source, private and secure, but still have great features. [PrivacyTools.io](https://privacytools.io) is a great place to find alternatives to more products & services.
