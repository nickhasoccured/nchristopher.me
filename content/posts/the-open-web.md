I've always thought that everyone should have a website.

It doesn't have to be a big, gigantic project, it could even just be a page that says hello.

Our identities on the internet often only exist on others' websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Having your own website puts you in control, and that's important for an open web.

Not to say social media is necessarily bad - we've just put too much control in big, for-profit companies. If all the big platforms decided to ban your accounts, you'd likely be wiped off from the internet. Unless you had a substantial following, you would probably be forgotten, with little evidence you ever existed on those sites. Having your own website circumvents this.

Here's the problem: despite the internet being an open standard, the web is quite centralized (which is a bad thing). While I'm sure companies like ICANN have great intentions, it's still not great.

Take Bitcoin for example, while there's _still_ a central entity publishing it's protocol, you don't have to follow that to use Bitcoin (though most people do, as it _is_ quite good). The control still resides with the end user. The web should be more like this.
