[Signal](https://signal.org/) was a refreshing take on privacy. It employed strong end-to-end encryption, was open-source, and was something I could genuinely put my trust in.

_However_, that has changed recently. Signal [introduced](https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1379472676905963523) crypto payments in the latest preview of their app - and it's more or less just a scam. For starters, they're using "MobileCoin", which nobody has ever heard of. But the real issue is that the coin is **pre-mined**, in other words, every coin has already been created.

They sold around 25% of it to investors, and kept the remainder. Which means that _if_ people begin to use the currency & give it value, they can **sell their coins** and create money out of thin air. And that's just [the tip of the iceberg](https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/mm6nad/bought_mobilecoin_you_might_have_been_scammed_375/).

This isn't the first time Signal has disappointed me, but I've never actually felt _betrayed_ by them.

For the past year or so, Signal (for whatever reason) neglected to release their server's [source code](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server). While it's impossible to verify they're actually running this (it means nothing privacy-wise), it still lets the code be audited, and free software is usually just better. They did (finally) update the repository a few days ago, but only after hundreds of requests to do so.

Unless Signal drastically changes & fixes this issue, I'll likely no longer be using the platform. Maybe someone will fork it for the better, who knows. For now, I'm gonna try to switch to [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), which seems to be doing well.
