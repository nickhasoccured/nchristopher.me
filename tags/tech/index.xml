      <description>Around a week ago, I decided to finally bite the bullet &amp;amp; switch to Ubuntu. It was relatively easy for me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have many files to transfer (most of my disk space was used by programs), and the Ubuntu installation process is much more user-friendly.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been gradually switching to FOSS services, so using Ubuntu (or pretty much any Linux distro, for that matter) was a no-brainer. I kept using Windows for so long because, for the most part, it worked well.</description>
