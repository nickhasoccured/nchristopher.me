      <title>Goodbye, Signal</title>

      <description>Signal was a refreshing take on privacy. It employed strong end-to-end encryption, was open-source, and was something I could genuinely put my trust in.
However, that has changed recently. Signal introduced crypto payments in the latest preview of their app - and it&amp;rsquo;s more or less just a scam. For starters, they&amp;rsquo;re using &amp;ldquo;MobileCoin&amp;rdquo;, which nobody has ever heard of. But the real issue is that the coin is pre-mined, in other words, every coin has already been created.</description>

      <title>Ubuntu Review</title>

      <description>Around a week ago, I decided to finally bite the bullet &amp;amp; switch to Ubuntu. It was relatively easy for me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have many files to transfer (most of my disk space was used by programs), and the Ubuntu installation process is much more user-friendly.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been gradually switching to FOSS services, so using Ubuntu (or pretty much any Linux distro, for that matter) was a no-brainer. I kept using Windows for so long because, for the most part, it worked well.</description>
