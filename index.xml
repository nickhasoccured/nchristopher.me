      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that everyone should have a website.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a big, gigantic thing, it could even just be a page that says hi.
Our online identities often only exist on others&#39; websites - like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Having your own website puts you in control, and that&amp;rsquo;s extremely important for an open web.
Not to say social media is some horrible thing, but it&amp;rsquo;s quite scary to think just how much control big tech companies have over the internet.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s well known that closed-source operating systems (like Windows and macOS) aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly good for privacy &amp;amp; security. There&amp;rsquo;s essentially no way for a closed-source system&amp;rsquo;s code to be verified.
Which is why people concerned about their privacy &amp;amp; security should use Libre operating systems, such as Linux. But that&amp;rsquo;s not where it ends.
The Intel Management Engine Intel&amp;rsquo;s Management Engine (ME for short, which is what I&amp;rsquo;ll be calling it) is a seperate computing enviornment present on every Intel chip since mid 2006.</description>

      <description>ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I&amp;rsquo;m Nick! I write code, sometimes it works. I&amp;rsquo;m currently using a (mostly) web-based tech stack, but I&amp;rsquo;m looking to branch out in the future! I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of privacy &amp;amp; open-source software, so most of my projects reflect that:
 Quoter - a Discord bot which stores quotes for servers &amp;amp; retrieves them on demand. It supports listing, (randomly) displaying, deleting, and editing quotes! PPS Credentials - a tool for PPS students to generate default credentials for their account.</description>
